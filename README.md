# Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict the loan status based on financial data. The goal was to identify the model that provides the most accurate prediction in order to inform decision-making.

# Financial Information and Prediction

The data used in this analysis can be found in the Credit-Risk Resources file under the name 'lending_data.csv.' The primary objective was to predict the 'loan-status' that indicated wether a loan was a healthy-loan (0) or a high-risk loan (1).
